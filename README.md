# Client Server TCP Project with Multithreading Server (C Programming Language)

This is a project that implements a client-server communication model using the TCP protocol, with the server programmed to handle multiple client connections using multithreading in the C programming language.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following tools installed on your system:

    C compiler (e.g. gcc)
    An IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

## Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your_username/client-server-tcp.git
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt
    Compile the server code using gcc server.c -o server -lpthread
    Run the server executable using ./server
    Compile the client code using gcc client.c -o client
    Run the client executable using ./client

## Usage

Once you have the server and client running, you can send messages between them by typing into the client terminal. The server will receive the message and display it in its terminal window.
